#### Grails Error: Error occurred running Grails CLI: No profile found for name [web].

```text
Sometimes after upgrading the version of Intelli-J that I'm using for development, when I try to run the command-line grails program, I receive the following error message:

Error occurred running Grails CLI: No profile found for name [web].
After searching around the web, I found that this was due to a problem with the build/.dependencies file located within your Grails project root. If you delete or rename this file, then run grails again, the dependencies will be corrected and you can run your app.
