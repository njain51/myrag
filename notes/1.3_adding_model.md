## Adding Model

- Instead of defining data in controller we will query it from database 
- in gradle model is called as domain.
- lets take domain as spreadsheet. 
- columns as different attributes, row as data in domain. 
- Three fields we have are Name, SKU, Price. 
- Name and SKU contain character, Price as Floating. 

- Right click Domain and create "Product" as our domain class. 
- it will create two files: 
```text
grails-app/domain/myra/Product.groovy    // Product Domain class file. 
src/test/groovy/myra/ProductSpec.groovy   // test file
```


- lets define different fields in our domain

```text
    String name
    String sku
    Float price
```
    
- When we save it, tables are automatically created in database. 
- We can access dbconsole for grails here: 
    
    **http://localhost:8080/h2-console**
- we will connect to Dev db for now: jdbc:h2:mem:devDb 
-  3 different db that ship wjth grails are : test, dev and prod. 
    
- Once in Db, we can run queries as follows: 

```text
SELECT * FROM PRODUCT 
    
    Name, Price and sku are columns we have added
    GRails will add by default : ID and Version column too. 
    
    Edit and add data as needed
    Added 3 rows 
```
**Note**: we will lose this data if we stop the application. 
 
- Next we will define new action and capture data we entered in database. 
 
```groovy
def list(){
 
         def allProducts  = Product.list() // This will give everything stored in Product domain to allProducts variable.
          [allProducts:allProducts]  // pass to placeholder allProducts which can be now viewed in list view.
 
 
     }

```

- Next, we will add new gsp under Inventory folder in view and refer this placeholder. 

```html
<body>

  ${allProducts.name }
  ${allProducts.sku }
  ${allProducts.price }

</body>
```
- Now when we check this url : http://localhost:8080/Inventory/list
- it will display dummy data just enteted by us: 
```text
[breakdfat, fflhwewe] [BB01, CD01] [22.33, 322.22]
```

- Let's format this data into table and display in view. 
- This gives much better presentation of data in table form.
