## Grails intro

**Grails:**

- its a programming framework for rapidly building interactive web applications.
- Its built on top of Spring Boot  and its Groovy based framework
- based on MVC architecture,
- MVC seperates your applciation logic into 3 distinct layers
  1: Model - data layer
  2: View - Presentation layer, eg., browser
  3: Controller: For Logic , for controlling , performing calculations and rules. .

  User make request to Browser => Request is received by web server =>  Dispather servlet runs of web server => sends requests to controler ==> it is here where most of time of requsest is spent =>  controller if needs data from database it makes a requst to model which talk to Db and returns data to controler

  Controller also constructs resulting web page by using template called View. Once it has page fully constructed then it sends back to web server via Dispather servlet to Browser to render ordinary web page.


**Grails Architecture:**
