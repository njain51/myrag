## Create First Contrller: 

- create package "myra" here grails-app/controllers
- Right Click myra => Create Grails Controller => Inventory
- it will create two files: 
```text
src/test/groovy/myra/InventoryControllerSpec.groovy  //For tests
grails-app/controllers/myra/InventoryController.groovy
```

- controller performs actions ,default action is index()
- added following code: 

```groovy
def index() {
        render "Here is a list of everything"

    }
```
- Run Application
  
- Now http://localhost:8080/Inventory/index should print above message on browser. 

- Rule for action is if only 1 Action is present in controller then default it will be executed no matter what its name is. 
- If more than one action then it will execute index() as default. 

- Added one more action remove(), and it can be executed as follows: 
```text
http://localhost:8080/Inventory/remove
http://localhost:8080/Inventory/ will still print index() action results. 
```
